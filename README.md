# ROBOTIC-ARM

This project presents the design and implementation of a **Robotic Arm system** developed to illustrate core principles of **robotics, automation, and control engineering**. The system integrates **mechanical design, electronic actuation, and software-based control**, enabling precise and repeatable movements across multiple axes.

## Key Features
- Four-motor actuation for controlled directional movement.
- Arduino-based microcontroller for reliable control and signal processing.
- Software implemented in **C** for motor coordination and task execution.
- Capable of performing tasks such as pick-and-place operations and motion demonstrations.

## Hardware Components
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino
- **Motors:** 4 DC/servo motors (for directional and positional control)

## Software
- **Programming Language:** C
- Controls motor movement and coordinates the robotic armâ€™s motion sequences.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of robotic kinematics and actuation systems.
- Hands-on experience in integrating hardware and software for automated motion.
- Foundation for further development in industrial automation and robotics research.
